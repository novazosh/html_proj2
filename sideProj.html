				<h1>About Me:</h1>
				<div class="words">
				As a student of Indiana University, I am currently creating pathways to define a happy and fulfilled adult lifestyle. Through the pursuit of a degree in Outdoor Recreation, Parks, & Human Ecology, I can create a career path which aligns with my passion for the environment. I am passionate about snow sports, hiking, education, ecological protection and technology. 
				
				Informatics is interesting to me because of its infinite applicability to many fields. While technology continues making innovations, this field will continue to grow and change, forcing me to adapt and learn.
